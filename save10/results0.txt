1. **Cuteness:**
   - **First Image:** 10/10
   - **Second Image:** 85/100

2. **Engaging Factor:**
   - **First Image:** 3/10
   - **Second Image:** 9/10

3. **Visual Distortions:**
   - **First Image:** None
   - **Second Image:** Slight over-saturation of colors, noticeable in the background

The first image, although visually striking with its golden text and dark background, lacks the element of cuteness as it does not depict any living subject or context that typically elicits affection. The second image, however, clearly shows a kitten with a very engaging and adorable expression, making it significantly cuter and more engaging. The only visual distortion is a slight over-saturation of colors, especially in the background, but it does not detract significantly from the overall cuteness. Hence, the kitten image scores higher in all aspects.
