The first image, depicting a cat with a tilted hat and monocle, is 90/100 in cuteness. The cat's serious expression and the dramatic lighting create a charming and engaging scene. However, there is a slight visual distortion with the monocle appearing slightly askew.

The second image, which seems to be a duplicate of the first, is also rated 90/100 for cuteness. It maintains the same charming and engaging qualities but with the same slight distortion of the monocle.

Overall, both images are very cute and engaging, but the minor distortion slightly detracts from their perfect scores. The cat's determined look and the stylish hat add a lot to their appeal.
