The first image has a score of 70 on the cuteness scale. The cat's pose and the playful movement through the garden under sunlight make it engaging, but the surrounding blur slightly detracts from the overall sharpness.

The second image scores 75 on the cuteness scale. The cat’s expression and the clearer focus on its features, combined with the dynamic movement, make it more engaging compared to the first. However, there is a noticeable visual distortion due to the overexposure around the cat’s fur, slightly affecting the image quality.
