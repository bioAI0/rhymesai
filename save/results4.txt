The first image scores a 75 on cuteness. The cat's tilted hat and thoughtful expression add to its charm, but the blur and lighting distortions detract from its overall appeal. 

The second image scores a 70 on cuteness. The cat's expression and head tilt are engaging, but the lighting is harsh and the image is slightly overexposed, reducing its cuteness. 

Both images have visual distortions, but the first image is slightly more aesthetically pleasing.
