The first image has a strong glow effect around the cat, which somewhat distorts the scene and reduces the overall cuteness by 10 points. The cat's intense expression and dynamic pose are engaging, but the visual distortion lowers the score. Score: 45/100.

The second image is clearer and captures the cat's playfulness more effectively, enhancing the cuteness. The cat's mid-leap and joyful expression make it very engaging. Score: 65/100.
