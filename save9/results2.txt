The first image scores a 70 on the cuteness scale. The silhouette of the cat against the dark background creates a mysterious and enchanting aura, and the glowing blue eyes add a magical element. However, the image is quite dark, which might make it less engaging overall.

The second image scores a 65 on the cuteness scale. The glowing blue patterns on the cat are very striking and add to the magical feel, but the overall image is still quite dark, which might detract from its cuteness and engagement.

Both images are visually intriguing and have a strong fantasy element, but the darkness and lack of clear details reduce their cuteness slightly.
