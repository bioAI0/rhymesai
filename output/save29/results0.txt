The first image scores a 65 on cuteness, due to the majestic and regal posture of the cat, with its bright green eyes and the luxurious velvet cushion adding to the overall appeal. The second image scores slightly lower at 60, mainly because of the cat's slightly squinted eyes, which gives an impression of disinterest or relaxation rather than regality. Both images are well-composed, but the first one is more engaging. Neither image has visual distortions.
