The first image scores a 75 out of 100. The cat is indeed lounging on a velvet cushion, and its posture is majestic and elegant. The lighting is soft, highlighting the cat's fur and making it look regal. The cat's eyes are enchanting, and there's a sense of serene charm despite the lack of a waving paw. The image is engaging, but the background is slightly dark, which slightly detracts from the overall composition.

The second image scores an 80 out of 100. The cat is in a similar pose, but the lighting is brighter, enhancing the whiteness of its fur and making it look even more majestic. The paw is more prominently visible, adding a dynamic element. The image is very engaging and the cat's expression is more focused and captivating. There are no visual distortions, and the background is slightly more balanced. 

Overall, both images are quite cute, but the second image edges out the first due to better lighting and a more engaging pose.
