Overall, both images are quite cute and engaging. The kitten's expression and playful demeanor are highly engaging, making them appealing. However, Image 2 has a slight edge in cuteness and engagement due to the clearer depiction of its playful expression and more visible details of its fur and whiskers. Both images are free from visual distortions.
