Based on the given prompt and the images provided, here are the ratings:

1. Cuteness:
   - First image: 85/100
   - Second image: 88/100

2. Engagement:
   - First image: 80/100
   - Second image: 85/100

3. Visual Distortions:
   - Both images appear to have some visual distortions, particularly around the cat's eyes and the lighting. The enhancement of the cat's eyes seems artificial, giving them an unnatural glow.

The first image has a softer focus, which adds to its charm, while the second image is sharper and more detailed, making the cat's features stand out more prominently. However, the overly enhanced eyes in both images detract from the natural cuteness, as they appear more like a digitally manipulated effect than a real cat's eyes. Despite these distortions, both images successfully capture a cute and engaging scene of the cat lounging on books.
