I would rate the cuteness of these images at 90. The cat's relaxed posture on the stack of books, combined with its mesmerizing green eyes and the cozy bookstore setting, creates an enchanting scene. The image is engaging and visually appealing. There are no apparent visual distortions. The lighting and composition enhance the overall cuteness and charm of the scene.
