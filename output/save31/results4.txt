In judging the cuteness and engagement of these two images, I'd rate them as follows:

1. **Cuteness**: 80/100  
   - The cat's relaxed posture and mesmerizing green eyes are quite captivating. However, the image is slightly blurred, which slightly detracts from the overall cuteness.

2. **Engagement**: 85/100  
   - The cat's intense gaze and positioning on the books create an intriguing and cozy scene that draws viewers in.

3. **Visual Distortions**: 
   - There are slight distortions in the image, particularly around the cat's eyes and ears, which might be due to motion blur or focus issues.

Overall, while the cat's charm is undeniable, the visual distortions slightly affect the cuteness score. The scene is engaging, but the blurriness somewhat diminishes the cozy, bookstore corner ambiance.
