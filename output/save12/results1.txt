The cuteness of the images can be rated as follows:

1. Cuteness: 85/100
   - The kitten has a fluffy coat and sparkling eyes, which are highly appealing traits. However, the pastel fur is not very evident, which slightly reduces the cuteness score.

2. Engagement: 90/100
   - The kitten's intense gaze and playful posture make the image very engaging. The snowy background adds to the charm.

3. Visual Distortions: 5/100
   - There is noticeable visual distortion, particularly in the second image where the kitten's features appear overly sharpened and unnatural.

Overall Average: 70/100
   - The images are quite engaging but are hampered by the visual distortions, bringing the average score below the typical cute cat score of 50.
