Both images are quite captivating, but let's break down the cuteness and engagement based on the provided criteria:

1. Cuteness:
   - Image 1: **75/100**
   - Image 2: **85/100**

2. Engagement:
   - Image 1: **70/100**
   - Image 2: **80/100**

3. Visual Distortions:
   - Both images appear clear with no noticeable visual distortions.

Explanation:
- **Image 1** is adorable, but the cat's expression and body language might seem a bit fierce or less playful compared to the second image.
- **Image 2** excels in cuteness due to the cat's more playful and curious demeanor, with its eyes wide open and mouth slightly open as if it's exploring the snow. The lighting highlights its fur beautifully, adding to its charm.
- Both images are engaging, but Image 2 edges out slightly as it captures a more dynamic and lively moment.

Overall, Image 2 is more likely to capture hearts, fitting the description of a "curious pastel kitten playfully leaps through the snow" more vividly.
