Based on the given images, here are the ratings:

1. Cuteness: 85/100
2. Engagement: 80/100
3. Visual Distortions: None detected

The kitten in both images is indeed very cute, with its fluffy white fur and expressive eyes. However, it is not actively pouncing, mesmerizing, or dancing as described in the prompt, so the engagement score is slightly lower. The images are clear with no noticeable visual distortions.
