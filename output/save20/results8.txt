Both images feature a majestic tabby cat with a striking and captivating gaze. Here's my assessment:

1. **Cuteness (1-100)**: 
   - Image 1: 85
   - Image 2: 87

2. **Engagement (1-100)**:
   - Image 1: 90
   - Image 2: 92

3. **Visual Distortions**:
   - Both images appear to have some pixelation and color distortions, especially noticeable around the cat's fur, which gives a slightly unnatural look.

The second image edges out slightly in cuteness and engagement, but both are very close. The cat's intense gaze and detailed fur are highly engaging, but the visual distortions detract slightly from their overall appeal.
