In evaluating the images, I will focus on several key aspects: cuteness, engagement, and the presence of any visual distortions.

1. **Cuteness**:
   - Both images display a tabby cat with a striking appearance. The cat's fur is well-defined, and its eyes are particularly mesmerizing. On a scale from 1 to 100, I would rate the cuteness of each image around 65. The cat's eyes and the overall composition are very engaging, but there is a slight digital enhancement that might take away from the natural cuteness.

2. **Engagement**:
   - The images are highly engaging due to the cat's captivating gaze and the detailed fur texture. The lighting and background are well-executed, drawing attention to the cat's features. These images score around 85 on a scale of 1 to 100.

3. **Visual Distortions**:
   - There are no noticeable visual distortions. The images appear to be clear and well-composed.

Given these considerations, the average score for both images would be 70. If an average cute cat scores 50, these images exceed that mark, but the slight artificial enhancement slightly detracts from their perfect cuteness score.
