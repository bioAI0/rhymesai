The first image:
- Cuteness: 60
- Engagement: 70
- Visual Distortions: None

The second image:
- Cuteness: 75
- Engagement: 85
- Visual Distortions: Slight color distortion in the cat's fur, making it appear unnatural

Overall, both images are quite cute, with the second image being slightly more engaging due to the cat's more pronounced expression and better lighting. However, the color distortion in the second image slightly detracts from its cuteness.
