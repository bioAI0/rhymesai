The first image features a cat with the sun setting in the background, casting a beautiful golden glow that highlights the cat's fur. While the lighting is stunning, the cat's face is partially obscured by the shadow, which may detract from its cuteness. Therefore, I would rate this image a 75 on a scale of 1 to 100 for cuteness and engagement.

The second image is clearer, with the cat looking directly at the camera. The sunlight highlights the cat's face and fur, enhancing its cuteness. The background is slightly blurred, which keeps the focus on the cat. I would rate this image an 85 on a scale of 1 to 100 for cuteness and engagement.

Both images are visually appealing, but the second one stands out slightly more due to its clearer focus and better lighting on the cat's face. There are no apparent visual distortions in either image.
