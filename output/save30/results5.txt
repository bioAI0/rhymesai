For the first image:
Cuteness: 75/100
Engagement: 80/100
Visual Distortions: None

For the second image:
Cuteness: 85/100
Engagement: 85/100
Visual Distortions: Slight blur, especially on the candle flame

Overall, both images are quite cute, but the second image scores higher due to its clearer and more engaging depiction of the cat interacting with the cupcake and its lit candles. The first image is also very cute but less engaging due to the cat's neutral expression. The second image's slight blur on the candle flame does detract a bit from its overall clarity.
