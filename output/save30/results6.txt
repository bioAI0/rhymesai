Image 1: 70
Image 2: 80

Both images feature a cat celebrating with a cupcake adorned with lit candles. The first image shows the cat with its eyes closed, appearing to sniff or nuzzle the candles, which adds a sense of curiosity and whimsy. The lighting and party hat enhance the festive feel.

However, the second image stands out with its clearer focus on the cat's face, capturing its wide-eyed, expressive gaze directly at the camera. The cat's playful demeanor and the warmth in its eyes add to the charm, making it more engaging. There is a slight visual distortion in the second image due to the close-up and focus.

Overall, Image 2 is slightly cuter and more engaging, with a score of 80, while Image 1 is rated at 70.
