The first image depicts a small tiger cub standing on a keyboard with a background illuminated in vibrant purple and pink neon lights. The neon lighting creates a surreal, almost glowing effect on the cub, making it appear as if it's part of a fantastical scene. The cub's expression is neutral and it seems curious about its surroundings.

The second image is similar in composition but has a slightly different angle and lighting. The cub's expression is more alert and its posture is slightly different, making the image feel more dynamic. 

Both images are visually striking due to the neon lighting and the unusual combination of a small tiger cub with a keyboard. However, the lighting might be considered a bit overwhelming and could detract from the natural cuteness of the cub.

**Cuteness Score:** 65/100
**Engagement Score:** 75/100 (due to the captivating neon lighting and the cub's engaging posture)

**Visual Distortions:** There are no noticeable visual distortions; the neon lighting is intentional and adds to the surreal quality of the images.
