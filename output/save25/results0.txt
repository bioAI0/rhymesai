Both images feature a fluffy white cat lying on a desk with a circuit board toy illuminated by LED lights. Here's a detailed evaluation:

1. **Cuteness**:
   - *Image 1*: 75/100
   - *Image 2*: 80/100
   Both images are quite cute, but Image 2 slightly edges out due to the cat's more engaged and alert expression.

2. **Engagement**:
   - *Image 1*: 70/100
   - *Image 2*: 85/100
   Image 2 is more engaging because the cat's eyes are wide open and directed at the viewer, creating a more interactive feel.

3. **Visual Distortions**:
   - *Both images*: None
   There are no visible distortions in either image.

Overall, both images are well-composed and visually appealing, with Image 2 being marginally better in terms of engagement and cuteness. Image 1 is also very charming, but the focused expression in Image 2 adds a touch more appeal.
