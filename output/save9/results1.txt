**Image 1: 30/100**
- *Cuteness*: 10/100 - The image is quite dark and the kitten is not clearly visible, making it hard to appreciate its cuteness.
- *Engagement*: 20/100 - The scene is mysterious but lacks clear focus, making it less engaging.
- *Visual Distortions*: 50/100 - Some elements are glowing, but they are not distinctly identifiable as a kitten.

**Image 2: 70/100**
- *Cuteness*: 40/100 - The kitten is more visible and appears cute, though the lighting is still quite intense.
- *Engagement*: 70/100 - The kitten is more discernible, adding to the enchanting feel.
- *Visual Distortions*: 50/100 - The glowing effect is cool, but it slightly distorts the image clarity.

Overall, both images have a mystical and enchanting quality, but Image 2 is more engaging and cute due to better visibility of the kitten.
