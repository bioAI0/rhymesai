In my opinion, both images are quite charming, but here are the detailed ratings:

1. **Cuteness**: 
   - Image 1: 75/100
   - Image 2: 80/100

2. **Engagement**:
   - Image 1: 85/100
   - Image 2: 90/100

3. **Visual Distortions**:
   - Image 1: None detected
   - Image 2: None detected

**Explanation**:

- **Cuteness**: The tabby cat in both images displays a fascinating mix of radiant fur and mesmerizing eyes, but the second image slightly edges out the first due to the more pronounced golden hues and the subtle details in the background, which enhance the cat's overall appeal.
- **Engagement**: The second image draws the viewer in more effectively with its vibrant sunlight and the cat's direct gaze, creating a captivating tableau.
- **Visual Distortions**: Neither image shows any significant visual distortions, maintaining the natural beauty of the scene.

Overall, both images are delightful, but the second one is marginally better in terms of engagement and visual appeal.
