The first image is rated at 85 out of 100 for cuteness. It captures a serene tabby cat basking in the sunlight, with a beautiful, warm glow highlighting its fur. The background is slightly blurred, which makes the cat stand out more. The cat's eyes are engaging, and the overall scene is very calming.

The second image is rated at 80 out of 100 for cuteness. It's almost identical to the first image but with a slightly different angle and lighting. The cat's eyes are focused directly on the camera, giving it an engaging look. The background is similarly blurred, maintaining a focus on the cat. There are no visual distortions in either image.

Both images are well-composed and have a soothing effect, but the first image edges out the second due to the slightly more captivating sunlight effect on the cat's fur.
