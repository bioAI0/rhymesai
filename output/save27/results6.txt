The cat in the beret is quite charming and its animated movements, such as blinking and waving its paw, are endearing. However, the painted portrait lacks the lifelike qualities you mentioned and appears slightly distorted. While the cat itself is cute, the painted portrait doesn't match the realism expected, reducing the overall cuteness score.
