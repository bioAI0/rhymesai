The images depict a remarkably lifelike painting of a cat with striking green eyes, wearing a beret and a blue ribbon. The cat's expression is confident and the lifelike quality of the painting is impressive. The tail is curled upwards, adding a touch of elegance to the composition. The background is dark, which makes the cat stand out more prominently. 

However, since this is a painting, the cat cannot blink or wave its paw, so the first part of the prompt cannot be assessed in terms of the image content.
