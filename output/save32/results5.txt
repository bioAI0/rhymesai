As a harsh judge of cuteness and overall engagement, I would rate the first image a 70. The cat is silhouetted against a stunning backdrop of the Milky Way, creating a serene and mystical scene. Its posture and the slight head tilt add a touch of curiosity and wonder, which enhances its cuteness. There are no visual distortions, and the composition is visually appealing.

The second image scores slightly lower, around 65. While the cat's pose is similar, its eyes are glowing, which might be seen as slightly unnatural or creepy in a harsh critique. The overall effect is less enchanting compared to the first image, although the starry sky remains breathtaking.

Both images are visually engaging, but the first one edges out slightly due to its more natural and enchanting portrayal of the cat.
