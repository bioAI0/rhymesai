Both images feature a black cat on a rooftop under a starry night sky, gazing upward at the Milky Way. The cat is depicted with glowing eyes and a luminous outline, adding a mystical and enchanting quality to the scene.

1. Cuteness:
   - Image 1: 75/100
   - Image 2: 70/100

2. Engagement:
   - Image 1: 85/100
   - Image 2: 80/100

3. Visual Distortions:
   - Both images are free of any noticeable visual distortions.

In Image 1, the cat's posture and the glowing effects contribute significantly to its cuteness, making it more engaging. However, Image 2 has a slightly more natural and relaxed pose, which I find marginally cuter. Both images evoke a sense of wonder and curiosity, perfectly capturing the cat's fascination with the cosmos.
