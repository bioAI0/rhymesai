Visual Distortions: Slight overexposure in the background

This image also features a lively cat jumping gracefully. However, the background is slightly overexposed, which slightly diminishes the overall visual appeal compared to the first image. The cat's playful demeanor is still captivating, but the visual distortion lowers the engagement a bit.

Both images are delightful, but Image 1 has a slight edge in terms of overall engagement and clarity.
